The defer module provides an easy way to write asynchrouns Python programms.
It is greatly inspired by Twisted's defer, but comes without a lot of the
dependencies.

At first defer was part of aptdaemon and moved to a separate project in
August of 2010.

The project homepage is at https://launchpad.net/python-defer
